Estimating Abalone density
==========================
By me, myself, and I. (`r as.character(Sys.Date())`)

Introduction
------------
If we can estimate the density of _abalone_, we never have to weight them again!

Theory
------
To estimate the density of _abalone_, we make the model assumption that they are rectangular boxes with their volume $V$ given as the product of length, width, and height:
$$V = 1/times w/times h.$$
The density $\rho$ is estimated as from the linear model
$$ = \rho V, $$
where $m$ is the measured weight of the abalone.

Data and calculations
---------------------
```{r,echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
dat <- read.csv("../abalone/data/abalone.csv")
dat$V <- dat$Length * dat$Diameter * dat$Height * (20^3)
dat$Whole.weight <- dat$Whole.weight * 200
model <- lm(Whole.weight ~ V - 1,data=dat)
```
We use the abalone that can be found at the [the UCI machine learning laboratory](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone). This data set contains information on `r nrow(dat)` _abalones_, including length, diameter, and height. The estimated density is `r coefficients(model)` grams per cubic cm with an R-squared value of `r summary(model)$r.squared`.

Conclusion
----------
This is may not be a realistic density, but the fit is pretty good.
